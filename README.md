# Weekly-Weather-App ☀️
## Challenge 6

### Description
The 5-Day-Weather-App is designed to be able to show the user the current weather conditions as well as the weather for the rest of the week. The user should be able to get their local weather forceast based on their location and the user can also search a specific city to look up the current weather conditions there. The user will also be able to see temperatures for the day and the temperatures for the night. There are also weather icons attached to the weather conditions so the user can see if it is going to be sunny or rainy just by looking at the weather icon.
